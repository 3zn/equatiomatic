# equatiomatic

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.org/datalorax/equatiomatic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/datalorax/equatiomatic)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of equatiomatic is to reduce the pain associated with writing 
code from a fitted model. At present, only `lm` models are handled, but
the hope is to expand to a greater number of models in the future.

## Installation

equatiomatic is not yet on CRAN. Install the dev version from GitHub
with

``` r
remotes::install_github("datalorax/equatiomatic")
```

## Examples

Below are a few simple examples of how to use the package.

``` r
library(equatiomatic)
# Fit a simple model
mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp, mtcars)

# Give the results to extract_eq_lm
extract_eq_lm(mod1)
#> [1] "$$\n mpg = \\alpha + \\beta_{1}(cyl) + \\beta_{2}(disp) + \\epsilon \n$$"
```

The equation is returned as a string. You can copy/paste it into your R
Markdown doc and it will render as

You can make copy/pasting easier by surrounding in `cat`. Or,
alternatively, preview the equation with `texPreview::tex_preview`.

``` r
texPreview::tex_preview(extract_eq_lm(mod1))
```

It can also handle shortcut syntax.

``` r
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars)
extract_eq_lm(mod2)
#> [1] "$$\n mpg = \\alpha + \\beta_{1}(cyl) + \\beta_{2}(disp) + \\beta_{3}(hp) + \\beta_{4}(drat) + \\beta_{5}(wt) + \\beta_{6}(qsec) + \\beta_{7}(vs) + \\beta_{8}(am) + \\beta_{9}(gear) + \\beta_{10}(carb) + \\epsilon \n$$"
```

For categorical it will place the levels for the coefficients as
subscripts

``` r
mod3 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Species, iris)
extract_eq_lm(mod3)
#> [1] "$$\n Sepal.Length = \\alpha + \\beta_{1}(Sepal.Width) + \\beta_{2}(Species_{versicolor}) + \\beta_{3}(Species_{virginica}) + \\epsilon \n$$"
```

And it preserves the order the variables are supplied in

``` r
set.seed(8675309)
d <- data.frame(cat1 = rep(letters[1:3], 100),
               cat2 = rep(LETTERS[1:3], each = 100),
               cont1 = rnorm(300, 100, 1),
               cont2 = rnorm(300, 50, 5),
               out   = rnorm(300, 10, 0.5))

mod4 <- lm(out ~ cont1 + cat2 + cont2 + cat1, d)

extract_eq_lm(mod4)
#> [1] "$$\n out = \\alpha + \\beta_{1}(cont1) + \\beta_{2}(cat2_{B}) + \\beta_{3}(cat2_{C}) + \\beta_{4}(cont2) + \\beta_{5}(cat1_{b}) + \\beta_{6}(cat1_{c}) + \\epsilon \n$$"
```

## Extension

This project is brand new. If you would like to contribute, weâ€™d love
your help\! We are particularly interested in extending to more models.
At present, we have only implemented `lm`, but hope to change that in
the near future. Stay tuned\!
