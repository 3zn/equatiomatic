# equatiomatic

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of equatiomatic is to reduce the pain associated with writing \LaTex 
code from a fitted model. At present, only `lm` models are handled, but the 
hope is to expand to a greater number of models in the future.

## Installation

equatiomatic is not yet on CRAN. Install the dev version from GitHub with

``` r
remotes::install_github("datalorax/equatiomatic")
```

## Examples
Below are a few simple examples of how to use the package. 


```{r example1}
library(equatiomatic)
# Fit a simple model
mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp, mtcars)

# Give the results to extract_eq_lm
extract_eq_lm(mod1)
```

The above shows what is output to the screen. When working in R Markdown, you 
then just need to copy the code to wherever you want your equation to show up
and it will render like the below.

It can also handle shortcut syntax. 

```{r example2}
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars)
extract_eq_lm(mod2)
```

For categorical it will place the levels for the coefficients as subscripts

```{r example3}
mod3 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Species, iris)
extract_eq_lm(mod3)
```

And it preserves the order the variables are supplied in

```{r example4}
set.seed(8675309)
d <- data.frame(cat1 = rep(letters[1:3], 100),
               cat2 = rep(LETTERS[1:3], each = 100),
               cont1 = rnorm(300, 100, 1),
               cont2 = rnorm(300, 50, 5),
               out   = rnorm(300, 10, 0.5))

mod4 <- lm(out ~ cont1 + cat2 + cont2 + cat1, d)

extract_eq_lm(mod4)
```

## Extension
This project is brand new. If you would like to contribute, we'd love your help!
We are particularly interested in extending to more models. At present, we have
only implemented `lm`, but hope to change that in the near future. Stay tuned!
