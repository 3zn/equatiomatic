# equatiomatic

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of equatiomatic is to reduce the pain associated with writing 
code from a fitted model. At present, only `lm` models are handled, but
the hope is to expand to a greater number of models in the future.

## Installation

equatiomatic is not yet on CRAN. Install the dev version from GitHub
with

``` r
remotes::install_github("datalorax/equatiomatic")
```

## Examples

Below are a few simple examples of how to use the package.

``` r
library(equatiomattic)
# Fit a simple model
mod1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp, mtcars)

# Give the results to extract_eq_lm
extract_eq_lm(mod1)
#> $$
#>  mpg = \alpha + \beta_{1}(cyl) + \beta_{2}(disp) + \epsilon 
#> $$
```

The above shows what is output to the screen. When working in R
Markdown, you then just need to copy the code to wherever you want your
equation to show up and it will render like the below.

It can also handle shortcut syntax.

``` r
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars)
extract_eq_lm(mod2)
#> $$
#>  mpg = \alpha + \beta_{1}(cyl) + \beta_{2}(disp) + \beta_{3}(hp) + \beta_{4}(drat) + \beta_{5}(wt) + \beta_{6}(qsec) + \beta_{7}(vs) + \beta_{8}(am) + \beta_{9}(gear) + \beta_{10}(carb) + \epsilon 
#> $$
```

For categorical it will place the levels for the coefficients as
subscripts

``` r
mod3 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Species, iris)
extract_eq_lm(mod3)
#> $$
#>  Sepal.Length = \alpha + \beta_{1}(Sepal.Width) + \beta_{2}(Species_{versicolor}) + \beta_{3}(Species_{virginica}) + \epsilon 
#> $$
```

And it preserves the order the variables are supplied in

``` r
set.seed(8675309)
d <- data.frame(cat1 = rep(letters[1:3], 100),
               cat2 = rep(LETTERS[1:3], each = 100),
               cont1 = rnorm(300, 100, 1),
               cont2 = rnorm(300, 50, 5),
               out   = rnorm(300, 10, 0.5))

mod4 <- lm(out ~ cont1 + cat2 + cont2 + cat1, d)

extract_eq_lm(mod4)
#> $$
#>  out = \alpha + \beta_{1}(cont1) + \beta_{2}(cat2_{B}) + \beta_{3}(cat2_{C}) + \beta_{4}(cont2) + \beta_{5}(cat1_{b}) + \beta_{6}(cat1_{c}) + \epsilon 
#> $$
```

## Extension

This project is brand new. If you would like to contribute, weâ€™d love
your help\! We are particularly interested in extending to more models.
At present, we have only implemented `lm`, but hope to change that in
the near future. Stay tuned\!
